// 3. Hierarchical Inheritance Problem:
//    - Problem Statement: Implement a hierarchical inheritance setup with a base class 'Person' and two derived classes 'Student' and 'Teacher'. The 'Person' class should have attributes 'name' and 'age', and a method 'introduce()'. The 'Student' class should add an attribute 'grade', while the 'Teacher' class should add 'subject'. Both derived classes should override 'introduce()' to include their specific details. Utilize constructors and the 'super' keyword appropriately.

class Person{}
class Student{}
class Teacher{}

public class Task3 {
    public static void main(String [] args) {}    
}
